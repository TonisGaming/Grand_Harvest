Loud
Find the vault
(If possible, the vault should be the one from Brooklyn Bank, so it's randomized if thermite, C4 or drill)
Equipment would be stored in the pickup truck in the parking lot or the van driver would drop it off
When interacting with the vault for the first time, it'll shock you
Turn the power connected to the vault off (1 of the power boxes that are on the roof)
Start breaching the vault (at this point, contractor will notify that all streets are blocked off, so we're going to Plan B)
Helicopter will have to be notified with a flare on the roof
Wait for cage parts
Build cage on the roof
When first vault is breached, contractor will spot the 2nd door
Cause no more equipment, brute force will be used for the keycard readers and the managers computer will have to be hacked
After 2nd vault is breached, you can loot as much as you want, and throw it into the cage
Deploy the fulton when x amount of loot is in the cage
Plane will pick it up
Escape would be us signaling the helicopter with a flare

Stealth
Find the vault
Hack one of the computers on the desk next to the vault
Find a keycard for the reader (4 keycards on the map. 1 on the cam guy, 1 on manager, 1 on first floor, 1 on second floor)
First vault open
Notice 2nd vault
Hack the managers computer
Use both of the readers
Vault opens
Secure the loot

Extra stuff:
The deposit boxes are extra
GenSec truck I placed would be random, if it's there (30% chance)
Contractor would be me, to make VO stuff easier etc
